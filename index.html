        <p>Hello! My name is Cauê Moraes and I am from Cuiabá, Brazil (it's a very hot city) I'm married with a beautiful and lovely wife. I like asian food but never left the barbecue from my heart. I enjoy games (Escape From Tarkov is my favorite) and currently enjoying programming and technologies. I heard about it watching a streamer called Jenni Oenning and then I started to search about it, so I found myself interest and studying somethings I made a decision to change my degree from Communications to software development and dove headfirst into the area. I work as host in the first and biggest portal in Brazil what news about the iGaming market and warning about the possible risks. I want to learn more about software development, how it can help in the future and maybe change my career. I like to think that it's never too late to learn new things.</p>
